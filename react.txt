check if you have node installed
node -v
if you see a version the you have node installed

npx create-react-app .
period means use the folder you are in.
you can also use any name for your folder.

once we click enter it going to create and start up our enter react application

if you drag your console up you will see some basic command 
the most important command is npm start.
npm start for development and npm run build for production.

the we take a look at the files. 
node_modules is for the libraries
the public folder we have essentially our html files
 what is special about the html file is that it only has one div. no stylesheet, no script tag nothing is inside of here just a single div 
 which root
 <div id="root"></div>

all of our application is going to be put in this root div.
react is going to generate our html and it is going to put it inside this div.
out html is very basic for the application.

the main meeting potato of this application is in the source folder
here we have all of our stylesheet javascript, test files, logos.
the main one we want to look at in the source folder is index.js 

ReactDom.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')):
which says render the content we pass in the < App/> at id="root"

if we go into our App component App.js
check out the basic code 
and run >> npm start
to see what our app looks like.

if we change something in the App.js it will automatically refresh and that is one of the interesting thing about react.

in our use case 
clear the code do just

function App() {
    return null
}

export default App

also remove the extra css and logo import 
remove everything except App.js and index.js.

JSX react version of HTML
embedding component inside a component
function App() {
    return (
        <TodoList />
    )
}

export default App;

in the src 
create a TodoList.js component

ES7+REACT/REDUX/REACT_NATIVE SNIPPETs extention 

to create the snippet
by typing rfc it will create a function component for us. and give it the name TodoList.js

in the App.js import the TodoList
import TodoList from './TodoList';

function App() {
    return (
        <TodoList />
    )
}

export default App;
